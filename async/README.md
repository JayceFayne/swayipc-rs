A Rust library for controlling swaywm through its [IPC interface](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/sway/sway-ipc.7.scd). This library is executor agnostic and can be used with any async executor!

## Usage

Examples of how to use the library can be found [here](../examples).

## i3 compatibility

[i3](https://github.com/i3/i3) compatibility is kept if possible even though this library primarily targets sway.

## Versioning

This library targets the latest stable release of [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway).

## Async runtime compatibility

By default this library relies on `async-io` crate, which uses its own thread. If you use `tokio` runtime and would like to awoid spawning the additial thread, you can enable the `tokio` feature:

```toml
[dependencies.swayipc-async]
version = "*"
default-features = false
features = ["tokio"]
```

## Contributing

 If you find any errors in swayipc or just want to add a new feature feel free to [submit a PR](https://github.com/jaycefayne/swayipc-rs/pulls).
